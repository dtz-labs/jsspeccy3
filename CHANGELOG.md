Unreleased
----------

* Add support for a local (PC) joystick / gamepad via the browser Gamepad API, with Kempston, Cursor and Sinclair mappings selectable via the `joystickType` option, the Joystick menu, or the `setJoystickType` API endpoint (Goran Devic)
* Add `joystickEnabled` configuration option (Goran Devic)
* Add controller selection when more than one gamepad is connected, via the Controller menu, the `joystickDevice` option, or the `setJoystickDevice` API endpoint (Goran Devic)
* Keep running - with audio - while the page is hidden, by handing frame
  pacing to the emulation worker, whose timers are not throttled in
  background tabs. Controlled by the "Run in background" File menu option
  and the `runInBackground` constructor option (default on)
* Add Timex TC2048 machine support, with all three SCLD video modes (dual
  display file, hi-colour 8x1 attributes, and hi-res 512x192), including
  switching screen mode part-way through a frame
* Add Timex TC2068 machine support (PAL): HOME and EXROM banks, the 8K
  horizontal MMU on port 0xF4, DOCK/EXROM selection via bit 7 of the SCLD
  register, and AY-3-8912 sound on ports 0xF5 / 0xF6
* Only fetch the ROM images the selected machine actually needs, in parallel,
  instead of fetching every machine's ROMs sequentially at startup
* Load TC2048 snapshots (SZX machine ID 8, .z80 hardware mode 14), restoring
  the SCLD screen mode
* Fix `pageIsContended` being too small to cover the Pentagon and TRDOS ROM
  pages, which read past the end of the array
* Fix a frame buffer view in the worker that passed a size where an end offset
  was expected
* Give the Timex machines tape loader snapshots of their own, so auto-loading a
  tape no longer switches the emulator back to a 48K, and generate them with
  `tools/make-tapeloader.js` rather than hand-patching a copy
* Fix the SZX halted flag being read from past the end of the Z80R block, which
  restored every snapshot with the CPU halted and corrupted PC by one byte at
  the first interrupt afterwards
* Fix the tape trap testing its entry addresses against a combined set of ROM
  pages instead of pairing each address with the ROM it belongs to
* Fix the test suite's WebAssembly import path, which pointed at a location
  the build never wrote to - the Z80 instruction tests had not been running.
  The suite now also exits non-zero on failure
* Tests no longer need `--experimental-wasm-modules`; the core is instantiated
  directly rather than through Node's experimental WebAssembly ESM integration
* Add GitHub Actions CI, running the test suites on Node 20, 22 and 24 and
  verifying a release build
* Upgrade webpack and webpack-cli so the build works on current Node versions;
  webpack-cli 4 could not load the ESM config, and webpack 5.44 needed
  `--openssl-legacy-provider` for its MD4 hashing
* Publish a playable build to GitHub Pages, and attach a packaged build to
  tagged releases


3.2 (2024-11-23)
----------------

* Add mappings from keyboard symbol keys to equivalent Spectrum keypresses (Andrew Forrest)
* Add support for the Recreated ZX Spectrum's "game mode" (Andrew Forrest)
* Add `keyboardEnabled` configuration option
* Add `uiEnabled` configuration option
* Add `loadSnapshotFromStruct` API endpoint
* Add `onReady` API endpoint
* Enable 'instant tape loading' option in sandbox mode
* Make keyboard event listeners play better with other interactive elements on the page


3.1 (2021-08-26)
----------------

* Real-time tape loading, including turbo loaders (except for direct recording, CSW and generalized data TZX blocks)
* Emulate floating bus behaviour
* Fix typo in docs (`openURL` -> `openUrl`)


3.0.1 (2021-08-16)
------------------

* Fix relative jump instructions to not treat +0x7f as -0x81 (which broke the Protracker 3 player)
